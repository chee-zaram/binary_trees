This is a project focused on the use of [binary tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree)
data structure. It shows the implementation of various binary tree operations
such as insert, deletion, traversal. Various functions also exist to get important
data about a tree, like the height, depth of a node, relations of a given node e.t.c.
